proud 🇸🇻 salvadoran!

Hello 👋, I am an aspiring programmer and cyber security analyst, currently studying said professions at CNM. As of now, me and a friend are practicing our coding and collaborative skills to better understand ourselves and other job-related stuff!

~ **; 👨‍💻 Programming languages and applications ;** ~

I am using **NeoVim** as my primary text-editor for 2 years now.

I am very fluent with many web-based languages, such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**; with a bit of React (**Next.JS**).

I am also very fluent with **Python** for both the use analytical graphs and artificial intelligence/neural networking.

Thanks to my Intro to Linux class I am better understanding the use of Git and Github!

~ **; 🎯 What I'm learnin' right now ;** ~

As of now I am learning **C++** from both by myself and classes ( since it is a requirement )

I am also learning the newly opened static page framework [**Astro**](https://github.com/withastro/astro)

---

~ **; 💻 Current projects I'm workin' on ;** ~

As of now, **no project(s) in the work**. Though I am planning with a friend of mine with some side project(s). From something simple and other advanced stuff using Python and/or C++!

I also have plans for a solo project using C/C++ on identifying many ports by using your home router ( nothing sepcial, but a way to help me understand C/C++).

~ **; ⌛ My past projects ;** ~

I have two major projects I have done;

1. **My [2020-2021 NM Supercomputing Competition](https://supercomputingchallenge.org/20-21/) Project; [unCAPTCHA](https://github.com/tardiobscurus/unCAPTCHA)**
    1. Won the Cyber Security Award
2. **My [2019-2020 NM Supercomputing Competition](https://supercomputingchallenge.org/19-20/) Project; [netDet](https://github.com/tardiobscurus/netDet)** (Though I do note; it doens't work with the recent Debian OS update. Yet to fix it)
